# Summary

The UD Frisian-FA-RuG treebank is a West Frisian treebank. 

# Introduction

This corpus contains sentences from the multiple genres: news, science, novels, culture, Wikipedia. The lemmas and PoS tags are manually verified. Morphologic and syntactic annotations were generated on the basis of a literal Dutch translation using an annotator that was trained on the basis of the UD Dutch LassySmall 2.5 treebank.

# Acknowledgements

Martha Hofman verifed the lemmas and POS tags of the larger part of the corpus.
